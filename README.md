# What's this then?

It's just a simple exercise to practice defining classes in Python. That's about it.

The code provided with the exercise (see `startpoint`) included predefined unit tests which we were instructed to write code to pass. The instructions we were given are in `task.md`. The code I wrote is in `student_class/src/student.py` and `team_class/src/team.py`.


# Right, and it does what exactly?

Well, nothing much, it's just a bunch of class definitions written to the specifications of the unit tests provided. If you want to check that the tests pass (which they do), you can run `student_class/run_tests.py` and `team_class/run_tests.py` from a terminal.
